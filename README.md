# Strings-as-objects
You need to decode a string:

If the string's first symbol is i, remove the first symbol. The string will contain a number. Print the number and add 1 to it.
If the string's first symbol is s, remove the first symbol. Then print the reversed remainder.
If otherwise, print the unchanged string.
